Game Logic

The player is given a clue to the mystery word at the start.  The player will guess a letter that they believe will be in the word.  If they are wrong a portion of the body will appear on the screen.  If they are correct the letter will appear in the correct place in the mystery word location.  If the player guesses incorrectly six times the game is over.  If the player guesses all the letters in the word then it is a victory.
